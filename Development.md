The development is broken down into several phases. The plan is to get the core working as a terminal application. Eventually it will be ported as an accessible-anywhere web app. Parts of the app will be kept modular so that they can be ported out to work in a different language. For example, the input module will capture keystrokes can have different implementation for a native program and a web app. So this module will be ported out to a different language.

### Phase #1: Input Module
- Should get input from keyboard.
- Should make the input from keyboard easily available for next modules.
